# Time-Series-Analysis-Project
Preliminary research of the rainfall phenomenon in India shows that it is dependent on various climatic control factors, which can be broadly divided as- latitudes and altitudes, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features. 
Due to variations in the geographical conditions of the country, the pattern of rainfall varies significantly as one goes from one region to another. We consider for our study the states of Kerala and Punjab. Kerala receives maximum rainfall during south-west monsoon (months June-September), along with some rainfall during north-east monsoon (months October-December), while Punjab receives rainfall during the monsoon season (July-September) only. Due to the interdependency of the climatic factors, we have assumed a multiplicative model for our study.
The state of Kerala shows a linear decreasing trend, with seasonal indices indicating that the rainfall occurs in the state mainly in 2 periods as stated above. The state of Punjab shows a quadratic trend which has been decreasing in the recent years. The seasonal indices, confirm a concentrated rainfall in a single period as stated above.
Using the Box-Jenkins approach, we fitted SARIMA models, for the years 1901-2000, on the basis of earlier analysis. The fitted models were judged on the basis of the predicted values for the years 2001-2017. Forecasts were obtained up to the year 2023.
